    <em>- Mobile apps vs. web apps: The pros and cons.</em>

    A study conducted by Perficient Digital on the growth of the mobile web in
    2018 versus the desktop found that 58% of website visits came from a mobile
    platform. This figure has been surpassing desktop for fourth consecutive
    years. Due to this, web developers must adhere to this situation by
    engaging in responsive design or mobile apps development. Both responsive
    website and apps offer sophisticated marketing tools for the company, yet a
    dilemma comes on deciding which to pursue.
</p>
<p>
    A responsive website was created in the era where websites weren’t so user
    friendly to be viewed on any devices. This method allows website to
    autonomously alter its content based on the width of every viewport. This
    approach has two major advantage which are easy to build and inexpensive
    since it is still based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax. Moreover, as it
    has common codebase regardless of mobile platform or operating system it
    can be accessed in any devices and it doesn’t need approval and download
    from the App Store. Despite the advantages, it has a few drawbacks for
    instance: it is totally dependent to the internet, it doesn’t support
    various advanced features (barcode scanner, NFC interface, artificial
    intelligence, and virtual reality or augmented reality).
</p>
<p>
    A mobile application or simply app is a tailored software that specifically
    made for mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets. The software is
    usually preloaded and made available on the apps store. Consecutively,
    users can download it and the information can be accessed without the
    internet connection. Mobile app boasts its ability to have better user
    experience than mobile website. It allows the user to engage actively using
    QR code, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS tracking, virtual reality and some devices
    those are smartphone compatible. Also, any credential for example:
    passwords, usernames, emails, credit cards, biometrics are kept locally so
    the user can seamlessly log in when using the applications. In contrary,
    constructing an app requires special set of expertise and must be
    individually customized to suit with the business goals. Moreover, the
    developer needs to create different platforms for the same application as
    there are numerous smartphones’ operating system in the market. An iOS
    application wouldn’t work for Android devices since they have different
    file extension.
</p>
<p>
    So, which is the best solution? It all depends on the scope of information
    and objective of the business’s website itself. When a business owner’s
    intention is to deliver sophisticated user experience (shopping cart,
    geotracking and user friendliness) and heavy load of information (thousands
    of products and services, flowchart, and multimedia). It is better to
    invest on building a mobile application. On the other hand, when the
    website is meant to accommodate a wide range of people with some budget
    limitation making a responsive website is more preferable.

    However, the right choice depends on your business objectives. If your goal
    is to offer mobile-friendly content to a wide range of people, then a
    mobile website is probably the way to go. However, if you want to engage
    better, interact with, and communicate with your customers to drive
    customer loyalty, a mobile app presents itself as a better option.
