    In the last decade, customers are changing from retail shopping to
    e-commerce buying trends. To cater to this phenomenon our job as web
    developer ensures the website have met these criterias: must be able to
    perform transactions (purchase information can be accessed by seller and
    buyer), reliable (performing well in high traffic situation), user friendly
    (easy to navigate and instructions are clearly defined), and secured (all
    credentials are encrypted internally to prevent any fraudulent use).
</p>
<p>
    Based on
    <a href="https://codepen.io/justinklemm/pen/zAdoJ">
        Responsive Shopping Cart by Justin Klemm
    </a>
    , to create a shopping cart we only need HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML
    creates the body or structure, CSS gives styling to the page and JavaScript
    creates the logic functions that makes out website to perform task based on
    inputs. The page provides concise example of simple shopping carts that can
    be applied to website.
</p>
<p>
    At this point we have understood how can website helps the business owner
    to generate revenue to their business. Have you ever wondered how some
    people can generate money from their website when the website is actually
    not selling any goods or services? They actually have monetized their
    website so earning an income while making postings. We have listed 6 ways
    to help our client make money from their website:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        <strong>Create a Pay Per Click Advertising (PPC)</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
We can use    <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/">Google Adsense</a> as PPC
    managers. The PPC provider automatically creates ads that are based on the
    webpage’s content and targeted to your specific audience. You get paid a
    small commission every time a visitor clicks on one of these ads on your
    website.
</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>
        <strong>Sell Ad Space</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Alternatively, when your website has attracted thousands of visitors in a
    day we can consider to sell ad space directly. This could be banner ads,
    display ads on the sidebar of your site or opt for pop-up ads. Do consider
    the ratio of the ads and the content, we don’t want to make a website that
    looks newspaper’s classified page. This will decrease the attractiveness of
    your page.
</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
    <li>
        <strong>Feature Sponsored Posts</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Sponsored content is basically just content from other sellers offering
    products or services that are relevant to your site visitors. One way to
    achieve this is by reviewing product in an advertorial post on your
    website. You want the information to be transparent and honest, so make
    sure to include any downsides the product may have and be straightforward
    when reviewing.
</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
    <li>
        <strong>Sell Digital Products or Services Online</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You need to have visually eye-catching products create a stunning landing
    page that will encourage people to purchase your product. Also, think about
    the product availability for you visitors or offer them as a pop-up or in
    newsletter. Make sure you are able to capture payments made using Paypal,
    credit cards or bank transfer.
</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
    <li>
        <strong>Create an Email List</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Email list will show who are your loyal customers. To get customers’ email
    is to encourage as many readers as possible to sign up for your email
    lists. These lists are a great way to let readers know what you’re up to,
    any exciting news regarding the site or to share products and services that
    may interest them.
</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
    <li>
        <strong>Offer Premium Content for a Fee</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Once the army of loyal customers have created. You can start asking them to
    pay for premium content and services through your site. This suitable for
    website with large audience. <strong></strong>
